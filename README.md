# Real-Time Website Traffic Analytics Using Distributed and Scalable AWS Cloud Services

## üìö Project Summary

This project implements a real-time data engineering pipeline designed to simulate and analyze website traffic logs using cloud-native technologies. Inspired by real-world software engineering practices, the pipeline demonstrates how log analysis can provide operational intelligence to support the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Using NASA‚Äôs HTTP Web Server Logs as the primary dataset, the project ingests, processes, stores, and analyzes high-velocity web traffic data in real-time. AWS services such as Kinesis, Lambda, S3, Glue, and Athena form the backbone of the pipeline, with Power BI used for visualizing key insights like traffic trends, top URLs, and system health metrics.

The end-to-end distributed architecture showcases scalable, fault-tolerant design patterns, emphasizing the importance of serverless cloud computing in modern data engineering workflows.
